# BCS Week 5, Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Getting Started

This project involved creating a 9am - 5pm Work Day Scheduler. We were given starter code that we needed to clone into our repo. The basic foundation of the html withjust a couple hours, leaving space for me to create the rest of the work day hours. Not only does the user need to input their schedule for each hour witin the work day, but also need to save to local storage. The creating of our own JS this week was a feat and I relied heavily on tutoring, watching previous classes, youtube, chatgpt, and google.

I started the whole process, with a very basic outline of what I wanted each file to store, making comments through out the page of how I wanted something to function or look.

I utilized several tools including but not limited to Xpert Chat, Bard, Copilot, MDN, Tailwinds site, ChatGPT.

**User Story**

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

**Acceptance Criteria**
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
